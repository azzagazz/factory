# Symphony Bootstrap

Symphony Bootstrap provides an easy-to-use HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework to create websites for the Symphony Network with a unified design.

The bootstrap offers:

- layouts to create single or multicolumn designs
- snippets to create common layout elements like articles, forms, buttons, tables, dialogs and more
- content structure and typography
- a universal Symphony Network navigation bar

[Symphony Bootstrap](http://symphonycms.github.com/bootstrap/) is freely available for all Symphony Network sites as a [Git repository](https://github.com/symphonycms/bootstrap/). Also, the new default workspace will be based on a modified version of the main layout.

## Funding

The goal is to make Symphony Bootstrap available and ready to use for the community late summer 2012. To turn this idea into reality, Symphony Bootstrap depends on your help to fund the work.

[Johanna](http://getsymphony.com/get-involved/member/Johanna/) and [Nils HÃ¶rrmann](http://getsymphony.com/get-involved/member/nils/) are up for the challenge and willing to invest their time. If you like the idea of a bootstrap and want to support the project, a donation would be very much appreciated.

The basic goal is 2.000 EUR (approx. US$ 2.500) , which will cover research, design and documentation. Of course, work will not stop after the initial release, but the more money is raised, the faster the bootstrap can move on. Thanks!
